Version: 1.0.0

Description: Implements models, methods and algorithms for decomposition, forecasting 
  and plotting demand time series. It is a class companion for students of courses in logistics. 
  The intention is to minimize the required knowledge of R for the user. 
  The functions are, hopefully, so formed as to support the student of 
  logistics to easily and successfully complete class assignments and 
  exercises. At the same time, it is hopped that the package provide for 
  the possibility of "do it your self" for those interested in deeper 
  understanding of the algorithms and willing to realize them in R script.
