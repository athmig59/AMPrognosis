\usage{
naive(
  d,
  future = 1,
  fp = 4,
  method = c("naive", "mean", "trend", "drift", "seasonal")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{{d}}{{numerical vector containing observed demand}}

\item{{future}}{{number of future periods to forecast, default 1}}

\item{{fp}}{{needed if the \code{seasonal} procedure is pecified in order to provide the seasonal period frequency, dafault is 4, i.e., quarters}}

\item{{method}}{{specifies which naive procedure to be used. The alternatives are:
\itemize{
\item\code{naive} {simply repeat the last observed value}
\item\code{mean} {the mean value of all historic data}
\item\code{trend} {naive trend projection, i.e., linear interpolation between first and last observation, and extrapolation into the future (cf. linear regression)}
\item\code{drift} {the amount of change over time is set to be the average change seen in the historical data (cf. naive trend)}
\item\code{seasonal} {naive consideration of seasonality, i.e., repeat for each time period the last observed value for the corresponding period in the previous season}
}}}
}
\value{
A data frame consisting of three columns:
\itemize{
\item\code{Demand} {it is the supplied \code{d}}
\item\code{Forecast} {it contains the predicted values for each period, icluding \code{future} periods}
\item\code{Error} { its the residual values expressing the difference between \code{Demand} and \code{Forecast}}
}
It returns NULL if the supplied order or seasonality is incosistent with the length of d
}
\description{
Naive forecasting procedures (see the \code{method} parameter)
}
\details{
Method \code{drift} is just a slightly different implementation of \code{trend}
and therefore both will produce the same forecast. You can verify this by
listing the results of the two procedures side-by-side, for instance, like this:

\code{df1<-naive(d,future=3, method="trend")}

\code{df2<-naive(d,future=3, method="drift")}

\code{data.frame(df1$Forecast,df2$Forecast)}
}
\examples{
## Load test data, for example, 
data("dTest1")
##
## Run the default naive method for three future periods
##
naive(d=dTest1,future=3)
##
## Run the mean method for three future periods 
##
naive(d=dTest1,future=3, method="mean")
##
## Run the trend method for three future periods 
##
naive(d=dTest1,future=3, method="trend") 
##
## Run the drift method for three future periods
##
naive(d=dTest1,future=3, method="drift")
##
## Run the seasonal method for three future periods
##
naive(d=dTest1,future=3, method="seasonal", fp=4)
